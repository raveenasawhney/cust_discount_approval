# Customer Discount Approval Repository

Welcome to the **Customer Discount Approval Repository** for AtliQ Technology! This repository is designed to streamline and optimize the process of approving discounts for our showrooms (customers), like Croma, while ensuring profitability and customer satisfaction.

## Overview

AtliQ Technology operates with a brick and mortar structure and they are considered customers, and the end consumers are the individuals purchasing products from them. This repository aims to manage and automate the discount approval process by considering various parameters that impact gross margin and overall profitability.

## Key Features

### Parameters

1. **Discount**: The percentage discount provided to the showroom (customer). The balance must be maintained to ensure company profitability and customer satisfaction.

2. **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)**: This includes all costs involved in producing and delivering the product. For example, shipment costs, especially from distant locations, can be modified to optimize expenses.

3. **Average Net Invoice Price (NIP)**: The average price per unit of the product after discounts. This is a crucial metric to ensure competitive pricing while maintaining profitability.

4. **Gross Margin (GM) vs Target**: The gross margin that the company aims to achieve to the target fixed. This helps in setting realistic and practical financial goals.

### Scenarios

1. **Best Case**: The most optimistic scenario where sales and discounts result in the highest profitability.

2. **Realistic**: The most likely scenario based on average market conditions and performance.

3. **Worst Case**: The most pessimistic scenario where sales and discounts are at the lower end, impacting profitability.

### Functionality
